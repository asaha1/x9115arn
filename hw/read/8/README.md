<h1>ii.	Most important keywords: </h1>
<b>ii1. SPL: </b>A Software product line is a collection of similar products of where all share some core functionality, where each differs in some specific features [10].</br>
<b>ii2. SBSE: </b>SBSE is a process of using computation search as a technique to optimize software engineering problems. </br>
<b>ii3. Program Synthesis: </b>The task of autonomously discovering an executable piece of code using various constraints such as input-output examples.</br>
<b>ii4. Genetic Programming: </b>It is an algorithm inspired by biological evolution to find computer codes that perform a user defined task.</br>

<h1>iii. Brief Notes: </h1>
<b>iii1. Motivational statements:</b> Feature model plays a critical role in capturing and expressing relationships between the requirements for products.</br>
<b>iii2. Best Practices: </b>Product line architecture is used to control the core features, shared by all products present  on the product line.</br>
<b>iii3. Future Work: </b>There are some possibilities for new avenues of work in which the community might apply computational search to software product line engineering. They are namely auto growing new SPL product branches, auto merging to tackle branch mania and retargeting existing SBSE at SPL.</br>
<b>iii4. Related work: </b>The term \'Search Based Software Engineering\', coined in 2001 [1], refers to the use of computational search as a means of optimising software engineering problems. Since 2001, SBSE has been used to address challenging software engineering problems with large and complex search spaces, characterised by many conflicting competing objectives, in areas as diverse as requirements [4], predictive modelling [2, 3] software project management [5], design [6], testing [7], refactoring [8] and repair [9]. This wide applicability to problems characterised by similar features to those found in SPL engineering, naturally suggests that SBSE will find successful applications in SPL optimisation. This observation has led to a recent upsurge in interest and activity in the area of `SBSE for SPL'.</br>

<h1>iv.	Suggested Improvements:</h1> 
<b>iv1.</b> Feature Model Construction: One important problem in SPL engineering is the     inference of products from a set of examples which is discussed succinctly in the paper.</br>
<b>iv2.</b> AutoMerging to Tackle Branchmania: It is easy for a model to grow rapidly which leads to the developer with and unmanageably extremely large number of different product variants.</br>
<b>iv3.</b> Low effectiveness of test: Where data types such as strings are concerned it is possible to build program structure without generation of any input.</br>
