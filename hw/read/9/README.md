<h1>ii.	Most important keywords: </h1>
<b>ii1. SLR: </b>Systematic Literature Review is to identify, analyze and classify the state-of-the-art research papers and provide an overview of the trends in a specific field.</br>
<b>ii2. WAT: </b>Web Application testing is necessary as our society relies more and more on the web and the dependability of web applications has become increasingly important.</br>
<b>ii3. SM: </b> This study is a follow up and complimentary study to a Systematic Mapping which was conducted in the area.</br>
<b>ii4. RQs of the study: </b> Three research questions are explored in the studies which are related to define selection and exclusion criteria, and synthesize the empirical evidence in this area.</br>

<h1>iii. Brief Notes: </h1>
<b>iii1. Motivational statements: </b> The web has had a significant impact on all aspects of our society. As our society relies more and more on the web, the dependability of web applications has become increasingly important. To make these applications more dependable, for the past decade researchers have proposed various techniques for testing web-based software applications. This literature search for related studies retrieved 193 papers in the area of web application testing, which have appeared between 2000 and 2013. As this research area matures and the number of related papers increases, it is important to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the publications and provide an overview of the trends and empirical evidence in this specialized field. [2]</br>
<b>iii2. Related Work: </b>The authors explain that this study is an extension of the Systematic Mapping study [1]. The paper classifies the related works in three categories: (1) secondary studies that have been reported in the broader area of software testing, (2) online repositories in software engineering, and (3) secondary studies focusing on web application testing. The studies are shown in the table below.</br>

<b>RQ3</b> </br></br>
<b>iii4. Patterns and anti-patterns: </b>The authors included 95 of the initial 193 papers in this study. They synthesized the following data/findings from the papers: (1) the types of input/inferred test models, (2) the fault models/bug taxonomy related to web applications, (3) test tools proposed in this area and their capabilities, (4) metrics used for assessing cost and effectiveness of WAT techniques, (5) the threats to validity in the empirical studies, (6) level of rigor and industrial relevance of the empirical studies, and (7) evidence regarding the scalability of the WAT techniques. In answering RQ 1.2, they have extracted the types of fault models/bug taxonomies specific to web applications. They also found that over 50 types of faults have been discussed. Test techniques targeting some of these fault types have been proposed. It is worth conducting more in-depth studies in future to ensure coverage of all the fault types by the test techniques and also the effectiveness of those techniques on detecting each specific fault type.</br>

<h1>iv.	Suggested Improvements:</h1> 
<b>iv1.</b> The authors haven’t mentioned why a follow-up complementary study to the systematic mapping paper [1] was done and in what ways they have improved in the paper. </br>
<b>iv2.</b> The SLR is carried out following the guidelines [3] but no clear explanation is given as to why these set of guidelines are followed.</br>
<b>iv3.</b> The authors explain that goal of the SLR study is to identify, analyze, and synthesize work published during the past 13 years in the field of WAT with and in-depth focus on the empirical and evidence-base aspects. But they didn’t take into account all the papers that were published in that epoch.</br>
