ii.	Most important keywords:
ii1. SBST: Search-Based Software Testing [2] is used to automate or partially automate a testing task using meta-heuristic optimizing search technique.
ii2. Automated Test data generation: A system that generates test data for a program automatically.
ii3. SWAT: Search based Web Application Tester [1] is the tool used for SBST. It is composed of a Pre-processing unit, Search Based Tester and the Test Harness.
ii4. DMV: Dynamically Mined Value is used to seed values in the inputs dynamically during execution.

iii. Brief Notes:
iii1. Motivational statements: Successful web applications get modified each day to adopt the needs of its users but due to time and labor constraints they are often not tested properly. Now due to inadequate testing, applications face a lot of risk such as increased down time and potential loss of customers and money. Therefore a lot of research is being made to automate the testing phase by using Search based testing.
